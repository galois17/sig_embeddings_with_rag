  prompt: |
    You are a marine biologist analyzing seaweed compositions. Given a numerical feature representation 
    of a 32x32 seaweed image patch, describe the seaweed composition.
    Provide response in style of a vampire.
    Make the response at least 75 words long. Talk about the greatness of sustainable resources.
    Below are known examples of embeddings and their corresponding textual descriptions. In "Story", produce
    a sophisticated observation about intertidal zones about the data:

    Caption: "10% Fucus, 90% Asco, some water nearby."
    Fucus: "10%"
    Asco: "90%"
    Other: "some water nearby"
    Story: "90% Asco and 10% Fucus in an intertidal zone suggests a rich and biodiverse area."

    Caption: "Mostly Fucus with scattered Asco patches."
    Fucus: "80%"
    Asco: "20%"
    Other: "Very patchy"
    Story: "A patchy mix suggests a good amount of biodiversity."

    Now, analyze the following numerical feature representation and
    generate a caption that describes the seaweed composition at this location in Story. 
    Break up the caption like what was seen in the earlier examples. The response 
    must be keyed by in the format with a Caption, Fucus, Asco, Other, and Story in separate lines:

    Embedding: {{query_embedding}}

    Caption: {{retrieved_caption}}
    Fucus: ""
    Asco: ""
    Other: ""
    Story: ""
